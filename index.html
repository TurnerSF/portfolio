        <h3 class="center" style="text-decoration: underline;">About Me</h3>
        <p class="center">Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Turner Shreve, and I'm excited to share my journey towards becoming a software engineer with you. I've always been fascinated by 
            technology and the endless possibilities it presents, so I decided to pursue a career in software engineering.</p>
            <p class="center">I am currently taking a program at Thinkful to achieve that goal, where I am learning the fundamentals of programming, as well as more advanced topics like data structures and algorithms.
        As someone who is passionate about problem-solving and creating solutions, I find software engineering to be the perfect fit for me. I am constantly striving to improve my skills
         and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in the industry. Through my coursework and personal projects, I am building a strong foundation of knowledge and experience that will enable me to succeed in this field.
         Additionally, software engineering is often a collaborative effort, and working with others can provide opportunities to learn new skills, gain different perspectives, and build 
         connections in the industry. I look forward to collaborating with other software engineers and developers to create innovative solutions and contribute to meaningful projects. By 
         working together, we can tackle complex challenges and achieve even greater success.</p>
        <p class="center">When I was younger, I used to be quite active and enjoyed engaging in different sports. Skateboarding and football were two activities that I particularly enjoyed.
            I used to spend a lot of my free time skateboarding around, trying out new tricks and perfecting my technique. I would often go to my local skate park with my friends
            and we would spend hours there. Skateboarding was not only a fun activity, but it also helped me to develop balance, mental toughness, and confidence.
            In addition to skateboarding, I also enjoyed playing football. I was part of my high school team and would regulary attend workout sessions and practices. 
            The part I loved most in Football was fogetting everything going on in my life and just focusing on the game. I also enjoyed the camaraderie that came with being part of a team. 
            Overall, skateboarding and football were two activities that provide me with a lot of joy and helped me to develop important skills that I still use today. Although, I dont get to do much of either
            anymore my intrest in the sports has not dwindled a bit.
