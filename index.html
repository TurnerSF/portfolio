        <p class="center">Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Turner Shreve, and I'm excited to share my journey towards becoming a software engineer with you. I've always been fascinated by 
            technology and the endless possibilities it presents, so I decided to pursue a career in software engineering.</p>
            <p class="center">I am currently taking a program at Thinkful to achieve that goal, where I am learning the fundamentals of programming, as well as more advanced topics like data structures and algorithms.
        As someone who is passionate about problem-solving and creating solutions, I find software engineering to be the perfect fit for me. I am constantly striving to improve my skills
         and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in the industry. Through my coursework and personal projects, I am building a strong foundation of knowledge and experience that will enable me to succeed in this field.</p>
        <p class="center">In addition to my studies, I enjoy reading and staying informed about emerging technologies, attending tech meetups and events, and collaborating with other developers. 
            I believe that being a part of a community is an important aspect of being a software engineer, and I am excited to continue learning and growing with my peers.
